# Socialized Crime Reporting DApp

We provide a safe, private, and anonymous platform for reporting and verifying criminal incidences with our Socialized Crime Reporting DApp. It makes use of zkLogin to provide a smooth and intuitive authentication process and the Avalanche Network to safeguard data.

# How it works

###  User Authentication with zkLogin:

###### Users can sign up using their current Web2 login credentials from Twitch and Google, among other providers. This makes it unnecessary to keep track of or recall private keys, which facilitates rapid and simple authentication.

### User-Submitted Crime Reports:

###### Verified users can securely submit comprehensive crime reports in confidence. Their identity is kept secret thanks to encryption methods.

### Blockchain Infrastructure:

###### The reports that are submitted are saved using Metamask on the Avalanche Network, a scalable and extremely efficient blockchain platform. Transparency and data integrity are thus guaranteed.

### Role-Based Access Control:

###### Only superior officials, including courts and police, can see and approve all reports that are turned in. Processing reports quickly and accurately is ensured by this role-based system.

### User-Friendly Interface:

###### Thanks to Next.js and the SUI Network, the DApp has an easy-to-use interface. Report submission and tracking are both simple for users.

### Social Interaction:

###### In addition to crime reporting, the platform provides a social media area where users can discuss crime news, exchange perspectives, and communicate with other users, all of which promote community awareness and involvement.

### User Reward System:

###### We are planning to implement a credit system to encourage users to actively participate. Credits are awarded to users who submit accurate crime reports. By offering a variety of redemption options, these credits promote community safety contributions.

### Security and Compliance:

###### User data is safeguarded by stringent security protocols and frequent audits. When it comes to privacy and crime reporting laws, the DApp abides by them.
